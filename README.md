# Hello, I'm Nhi üëã

### From HR to Engineering

My path into software engineering wasn't typical. Fresh out of college with an HR degree, I felt a deep desire to **build something that truly mattered**. What started as a hobby in 2021 quickly transformed into a revelation: coding offered a direct "superpower" ‚Äì the ability to craft solutions, solve real-world problems, and turn ideas into tangible products. That feeling of direct impact was incredibly empowering, and by 2022, I knew I had to jump in with both feet.

### Two Years in the Dev Trenches üöÄ

After two years immersed in full stack development, primarily with **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Nodejs, PHP and Laravel**, I've experienced the full spectrum of building. From the sheer joy of creating intuitive user interfaces to the sometimes-frustrating (and then hilariously satisfying) moments of battling stubborn bugs, every challenge has fueled my passion. I love the grit of problem-solving and the ultimate satisfaction of shipping user-centric features.

My drive comes from a deep desire to make a huge, tangible difference through technology. I'm always seeking opportunities to apply my skills to missions that genuinely help people and empower positive change.
